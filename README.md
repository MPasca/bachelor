# Design and Implementation of a 2D Game Engine: Algorithmic Approaches and Performance Optimization

The project consists in the creation of a 2D game engine centered around the maze generation and pathfinding algorithms needed for developing 2D top-down maze-chase applications. The engine uses a SDL2 framework created in-house for scalability, flexibility and ease of manipulation, and for providing an extra layer of security to the application.
